					<p>Key Achievements:</p>
					<ul class="ListStyleOne">
						<li>A $2.1 billion US subsidiary of a $8 billion international semiconductor equipment technology and manufacturing company. The US Holding company owns five independent entities which include manufacturing plants, technology development operations, and service facilities for wholesale tooling products. </li>
						<li>Implemented international GAAP (General Accepted Accounting Practices) and controls to ensure timely and accurate G/L closing and reporting for subsidiaries located in China, Japan; Taiwan; UK and Australia.  Streamlined these reporting entities through transfer of accounting functions to the parents’ regional corporate office and closing of the regional entity.</li>
						<li>Refined the accounting collection and reporting processes in the accounting ERP system to allow for scalable reporting and analysis.  As a result, the ERP system was reprogrammed from a single dimensional data collection system to a multi-dimensional database. </li>
						<li>Implemented measurable scaling systems which allowed smooth transitions and growth from a single sales and service organization, with annual sales in 2002 of $500 million, to a multi-entity and multi-product environment with annual sales of over $2.5billion by the end of 2014. The additions of three separate manufacturing entities added $200 million in annual revenues. These growth and business complexities could be integrated with minimal disruptions due to the flexible scaling systems implemented.</li>
						<li>Developed acquisition models used in the calculation of public entity valuations. The models were used in parallel with financial models of an international merchant bank who helped with the acquisitions.   The investments in these manufacturing organizations have exceeded $800 million.  </li>
						<li>Restructured $40 million of leased equipment debt to an intercompany arrangement with a reduced interest rate from 6% to 2% and reduced the consolidated parent interest rate to .5%.  This equated to an annual saving of $3 million for the region and almost $2 million for the consolidated company.  </li>

						<li>Redesigned and reorganized the IT department from a user dependent and reactionary culture to a customer engaged and proactive strategic one.  The new structure requires the IT staff to engage with all functional areas of the company to ensure the technology roadmap aligns with their strategic initiatives.    This new design requires IT participation in strategic planning and senior management meetings. </li>
						<li>Key member in the redesign of the company’s medical benefit plan.  This changed the fully- insured plan to a self-funded plan with ceiling protection.  This new plan reduced the annual benefit expense by over $4 million for the group.</li>
						<li>Initiated leadership training programs for IT and Accounting employees.  The two departments had several long-term employees who very technically focused but were not engaged in change management.  The growth of the company into manufacturing and technology depended on proactive leaders and innovators who perceived change as a strategic necessity.  The training classes aimed to transition key managers from technical providers to proactive leaders instrumental to developing solutions to the company’s roadmap.</li>
